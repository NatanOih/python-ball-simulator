# python-ball-simulator
throw balls inside and watch them bounce


installing pygame is needed
(pip install pygame in command line)

notes:

    -objects crushing into each over with high velocity will become one.
  
    -you cant creat objects outside of the white box
  
    -hold mouse left click and drag it into desired release point if you want to throw an object, the speed and angle will be determined based on the positionn of the      mouse courser between the `click` point and the releasing point
